# Pec: Portable Emacs Configuration

Fork of emfred-dot-com's Emacs configuration.

# Installation

```sh
# assuming Emacs is installed, and ~/.emacs.d/ does not exist
mkdir ~/.emacs.d
cd ~/.emacs.d
git clone https://github.com/emfred-dot-com/pec.git
```

# Documentation

No overarching attempt was made to document this configuration.
Comments in the elisp files are present but probably not very helpful
to other people. I may revise them at some point.
