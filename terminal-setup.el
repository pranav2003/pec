small, or a small value if it's large. The values used for \"small\" and
\"large\" are determined by the variables `vterm-session/normal-line-length'
and `vterm-session/long-line-length'.

The rationale behind this command, and the aforementioned variables, is as
follows:

A known issue (URL `https://github.com/akermu/emacs-libvterm/issues/179') in
`vterm' makes it such that text which gets wrapped when fallling outside of
a frame boundary (due to resizing from the window manager) gets clipped out
of existence when the window is resized back to a size which should
re-include that text.

It's possible to work around this problem by setting
`vterm-min-window-width' to a number of columns that's large enough such
that the lines never wrap. However, this messes with the output of commands
like `ls', as with a large `vterm-min-window-width' the output will lie all
on a single line of text (since it isn't wrapping).

With all of this in mind, a good workaround workflow can be achieved by
toggling this long line length on when we need it (i.e. are about to have
long-lined text on screen which we may need to resize), and then back off
when we no longer need it (so that the output of common commands can wrap
normally)."
